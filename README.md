# highbird
highbird is a hbase orm framework, it works like hibernate


Hello,

thanks for using my highbird framework project.

why i named the framework as highbird?
because the framework like the bird.
Although the framework is small,but the functions are fully equipped.(麻雀虽小，五脏俱全嘛)，
and I hope this framework will be fly very high.


if you have any good idea, please contact me.

thanks.
